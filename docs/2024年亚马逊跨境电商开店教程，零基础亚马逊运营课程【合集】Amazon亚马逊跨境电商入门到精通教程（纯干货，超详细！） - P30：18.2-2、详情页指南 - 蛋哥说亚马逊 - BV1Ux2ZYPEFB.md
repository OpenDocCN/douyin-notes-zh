 color and texture。Listings with missing images are suppressed from the site。

This could result in missed sales opportunities。The best product images have a pure white background are at least 1000 pixels on their longest side so customers can zoom in for more detail。

 avoid using all caps and don't include promotional messages or subjective commentary。Remember。
