To streamline the shipping process， Amazon uses scannable barcode labels on every product。

These barcodes help identify the product， for example， a specific book title or replacement part。

Barcodes also identify you as the FB seller of that unit。

 so you get credit for the sale Barcodes help us identify and track your products throughout the entire fulfillment process every unit you send to FBA requires a barcode。

 You have three options when labeling your product use an existing manufacturer barcode apply a unique Amazon barcode label yourself or for a small fee use the FB label service to apply the Amazon barcode for you we default to manufacture barcodes on eligible products to speed up delivery to customers。

When you receive a customer order， we might fulfill that order using another seller's unit of the same product when the other seller's unit is closer to the customer。

You receive credit for the sale。 We then instantly transfer a unit from your inventory to that of the other seller。

FBA tracks each unit individually and keeps them in separate physical locations。

Each time you create a shipment， a notification on the set quantity page will show which of your offers qualify for the manufacturer barcode。

If there is no eligible manufacturer barcode for your product， an Amazon barcode is required。

You can either apply this barcode yourself or use the FB label service for a small per unit fee。

If you use the FB label service， mark each item as labeled by Amazon in your shipping plan and we'll take care of the rest。

If you want to print and apply the Amazon barcode labels yourself。

 you'll need correctly sized blank mailing labels and a laser printer。 We recommend Avery 5160。

 but other label sizes will work too。

![](img/77e3ca9bc034e3194a40128cf73158be_17.png)

Just make sure they are between one and2 inches tall and2 and3 inches wide。For best results。

 use a laser printer and print at 300 DPI。For large shipments。

 be sure to select all pages and generate a label file for each page。



![](img/77e3ca9bc034e3194a40128cf73158be_19.png)

Remember， all Amazon barcodes must be printed in black ink on white。

 self adhesive non reflective labels。

![](img/77e3ca9bc034e3194a40128cf73158be_21.png)

Your barcode labels will include a scannable barcode， a number corresponding to the barcode。

 also called the FN SkuU， the product title， and product condition。

Use the product title and condition to match labels with the correct units If you have trouble finding a match。

 you can generate a packing list to match FN Skus with their corresponding products。

Clear crispP labels that are properly placed on the right units are key to efficient shipments and more satisfied customers。

For this reason， Amazon doesn't accept damaged or photocopied labels。



![](img/77e3ca9bc034e3194a40128cf73158be_25.png)

Place the label on your product。If your product doesn't need extra packaging。

 cover any original barcodes such as UPC， EAN， or ISBN codes。

 then put the Amazon label on a smooth surface， avoiding corners， edges， or curves。

For products that do require extra packaging， such as bubble wrap or other protective packaging。

 add your labels on the outside。 This way， they are easily scannable when they arrive at the fulfillment centers。

That was a lot of information， so let's review。When labeling products for fulfillment by Amazon。

 be sure to use only clean laser printed self adhesive labels。Put the correct barcode on each unit。

Cover all other visible barcodes with the exception of any serial number barcodes。

Place the barcode on the outside of any packing materials。Do not place the label on a curve。

 edge or corner。When creating a shipment on the labelbel Products tab。

 you need to choose who prints the label， Amazon or merchant， the number of labels to print。

 and then select print labelbels。
